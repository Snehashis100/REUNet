## Features

- M<sup>3</sup>ONet relies on a strong encoding pathway, enabling precise segmentation of target lesions across diverse regions
- The integration of a novel module named DMBC in M<sup>3</sup>ONet helps the model to focus on the intrinsic features for better understanding of the interclass relationship.
- M<sup>3</sup>ONet undergoes testing on five distinct multimodal datasets, showcasing its exceptional capacity for generalization compared to other state-of-the-art models.
- M<sup>3</sup>ONet also exhibit low computational complexity that makes it suitable for real world applications.

## Usage

1. Install all the required packages from the requirment.txt file.
2. Create an object of M<sup>3</sup>ONet by the following code:
     ```
     m3onet = M3ONet.model(num_classes, output_activation, input_shape = (256,256,3))
     # provide num_classes, output_activation, and input_shape based on your  requirment.
     ```
3. Once the object is created, compile and train the model based on your requirement.

## Dataset used in our paper

1. DUKE Breast Cancer dataset.
2. BraTS20202.
3. KiTS2023.
4. INBreast.
5. FracAtlas.
